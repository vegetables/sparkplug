Sparkplug
A quick Rails 3.1 app template
A modified template from RailsWizard

Usage:

rvm gemset create <some-gemset>
rvm use <ruby-version>@<some-gemset>
gem install rails

rails new <app-name> -m /path/to/sparkplug/sparkplug.rb -T -d postgresql

Notes:

This project was built with my needs in mind. Specifically: postgresql, sorcery (not devise), HTML5 ERB layout.  
It will be made more extensible in the future.
